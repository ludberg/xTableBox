## Features

xTableBox is the equivalent of a Table Box in QlikView. During development it is very common to want to display all columns and rows from a specific table in your data model.

With this extension you get to simply select which table from your data model you want to browse and a table with all the columns will be generated. 

This is much faster than adding a regula table to your sheet and then add all columns manually. 

## Usage

1. Simply drag and drop the xTableBox extension onto a sheet and select a table.

## Installation
